Questions:
----------

1. Should I try to fix the bugs with the current animation before adding more ?
- In my current ledge grab and vaulting, I am seeing a lot of polish is required. 
- But i also miss a lot of other animations as well.

- I think I should add more stuff... that will reveal even more stuff to fix.
